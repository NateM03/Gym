  id: string (cuid)
  email: string (unique)
  username: string (unique)
  passwordHash: string
  createdAt: DateTime
  // Relations
  profile: UserProfile (1:1)
  stats: UserStats (1:1)
  plans: WorkoutPlan[] (1:many)
  workoutLogs: WorkoutLog[] (1:many)
  follows/followers: Follow[] (many:many via Follow table)
  userRewards: UserReward[] (1:many)
}
```

**Purpose**: Central user entity with authentication and relationships.

#### UserProfile
```typescript
{
  age: number
  heightCm: number (stored in cm, converted from feet/inches)
  weightKg: number (stored in kg, converted from lbs)
  sex: string
  experienceLevel: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
  goal: 'build_muscle' | 'lose_weight' | 'strength' | 'endurance' | 'general_fitness'
  daysPerWeek: number (1-6)
  equipment: JSON array (e.g., ['dumbbells', 'barbell', 'bench'])
}
```

**Purpose**: Stores user preferences for workout generation. Equipment stored as JSON array for flexibility.

#### WorkoutPlan
```typescript
{
  id: string
  userId: string
  name: string (e.g., "Push/Pull/Legs (Custom)")
  goal: string (from profile)
  active: boolean (only one active at a time)
  createdAt: DateTime
  days: WorkoutDay[] (1:many)
}
```

**Purpose**: Container for a complete workout routine. Users can have up to 4 plans.

#### WorkoutDay
```typescript
{
  id: string
  workoutPlanId: string
  dayIndex: number (0-based, for ordering)
  title: string (e.g., "Push", "Chest & Back")
  exercises: WorkoutDayExercise[] (1:many)
  logs: WorkoutLog[] (1:many)
}
```

**Purpose**: Represents a single day in a workout plan. Can be repeated (e.g., PPL has 6 days: Push, Pull, Legs, Push, Pull, Legs).

#### WorkoutDayExercise
```typescript
{
  id: string
  workoutDayId: string
  exerciseId: string
  order: number (for sequencing)
  sets: number (user-defined, 0 initially)
  reps: string (user-defined, e.g., "8-12" or "10")
  restSeconds: number | null (user-defined)
}
```

**Purpose**: Links exercises to workout days with user-customized parameters. Sets/reps/rest are set by user when starting workout.

#### Exercise
```typescript
{
  id: string (cuid)
  name: string (e.g., "Incline Dumbbell Press")
  muscleGroup: string (e.g., "chest", "shoulders", "triceps")
  equipment: string (e.g., "dumbbells", "barbell", "cable_machine")
}
```

**Purpose**: Exercise database. Currently 100+ exercises with variations (incline, decline, seated, standing, etc.).

#### WorkoutLog
```typescript
{
  id: string
  userId: string
  workoutDayId: string | null
  date: DateTime
  completed: boolean
  exerciseLogs: ExerciseLog[] (1:many)
}
```

**Purpose**: Records a completed workout session. One log per workout day per day.

#### ExerciseLog
```typescript
{
  id: string
  workoutLogId: string
  exerciseId: string
  setNumber: number (1, 2, 3, ...)
  weight: number | null (in lbs, converted from user input)
  reps: number (actual reps completed)
}
```

**Purpose**: Stores actual performance data (weight/reps) for each set. Used for analytics and future recommendations.

#### UserStats
```typescript
{
  id: string
  userId: string (unique)
  totalXp: number
  level: number (calculated from totalXp)
  currentStreak: number (consecutive workout days)
  longestStreak: number
  workoutsThisWeek: number
  lastWorkoutDate: DateTime | null
}
```

**Purpose**: Tracks gamification metrics. Updated on every workout completion.

#### Reward & UserReward
```typescript
Reward {
  id: string
  name: string (e.g., "Starter Avatar")
  type: string ('avatar' | 'badge' | 'medal')
  requiredLevel: number | null
  requiredStreak: number | null
}

UserReward {
  userId: string
  rewardId: string
  unlockedAt: DateTime
  equipped: boolean (for avatars)
}
```

**Purpose**: Gamification rewards system. Unlocks automatically when thresholds are met.

#### Follow
```typescript
{
  id: string
  followerId: string
  followingId: string
  createdAt: DateTime
  @@unique([followerId, followingId])
}
```

**Purpose**: Many-to-many relationship for social following. Self-referential on User model.

## Core Systems

### 1. Authentication System (`lib/auth.ts`)

**Implementation**: NextAuth.js with Credentials provider

**Flow**:
1. User registers → password hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
2. Login → credentials validated against database
3. Session stored as JWT token
4. Protected routes use middleware to check authentication

**Key Features**:
- Password hashing with bcryptjs
- JWT-based sessions (stateless)
- Custom session callbacks to include user ID and username

**Security**:
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Session tokens signed with NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- Middleware protects routes automatically

### 2. XP & Leveling System (`lib/xp.ts`)

**XP Values**:
```typescript
WORKOUT_COMPLETED: 50 XP
WORKOUT_WITH_SETS: 20 XP (bonus)
STREAK_7_DAYS: 150 XP (bonus)
```

**Level Calculation Algorithm**:
```typescript
function calculateLevel(totalXp: number): number {
  // Binary search-like approach: iterate backwards through thresholds
  for (let i = LEVEL_THRESHOLDS.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (totalXp >= LEVEL_THRESHOLDS[i]) {
      return i + 1  // Level is index + 1
    }
  }
  return 1  // Default to level 1
}
```

**Level Thresholds** (exponential progression):
- Level 1: 0 XP
- Level 2: 500 XP
- Level 3: 1,200 XP
- Level 4: 2,400 XP
- Level 5: 4,000 XP
- ...continues to Level 10: 20,000 XP

**Streak Tracking Algorithm**:
```typescript
1. Get last workout date
2. Calculate days since last workout
3. If daysDiff === 1: increment streak (consecutive)
4. If daysDiff > 1: reset streak to 1 (broken)
5. If daysDiff === 0: don't change (same day)
6. Update longestStreak if current > longest
```

**Reward Unlocking**:
- Triggered after XP/streak updates
- Queries rewards where `requiredLevel <= userLevel` OR `requiredStreak <= userStreak`
- Creates UserReward entry if not already unlocked
- Prevents duplicate unlocks with unique constraint

### 3. Workout Generator (`lib/generator.ts`)

**Design Pattern**: Strategy Pattern (different generators for different routines)

**Routine Types**:
1. **Full Body** (3 days): A/B/C rotation, targets all muscle groups each day
2. **Upper/Lower** (4 days): Alternates upper and lower body
3. **Push/Pull/Legs** (6 days): Push (chest/shoulders/triceps), Pull (back/biceps), Legs
4. **Arnold Split** (6 days): Chest & Back, Shoulders & Arms, Legs

**Generation Algorithm**:
```typescript
1. Fetch user profile (equipment, goal, experience)
2. Filter exercises by available equipment
3. Group exercises by muscle group
4. Select exercises based on routine type
5. Order exercises (compound movements first)
6. Set default sets/reps/rest (user will customize later)
7. Create WorkoutPlan with WorkoutDays and WorkoutDayExercises
```

**Exercise Selection Logic**:
- Filters by equipment availability
- Groups by muscle group (chest, back, shoulders, etc.)
- Selects top N exercises per muscle group
- Orders by importance (compound movements prioritized)

**Custom Plan Support**:
- Users can select exercises manually
- System accepts custom exercise arrays
- Bypasses auto-generation when custom days provided

### 4. Workout Logging System

**Two-Phase Approach**:

**Phase 1: Planning** (optional, can be done during workout)
- User sets: Sets, Target Reps, Rest Time
- Stored in `WorkoutDayExercise` table
- Can be updated anytime

**Phase 2: Logging** (during workout)
- User logs: Weight (lbs), Actual Reps for each set
- Stored in `ExerciseLog` table
- Each set is a separate record

**Data Flow**:
```
User starts workout
  ↓
Sets planned sets/reps/rest (optional)
  ↓
Logs weight and reps for each set
  ↓
Completes workout
  ↓
Data saved:
  - WorkoutDayExercise updated (sets/reps/rest)
  - ExerciseLog created (weight/reps per set)
  - WorkoutLog marked as completed
  - XP awarded
  - Streak updated
  - Rewards checked
```

## Key Algorithms & Data Structures

### 1. Level Calculation

**Algorithm**: Reverse Linear Search
```typescript
// Time Complexity: O(n) where n = number of level thresholds
// Space Complexity: O(1)

function calculateLevel(totalXp: number): number {
  // Iterate backwards through thresholds
  for (let i = LEVEL_THRESHOLDS.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (totalXp >= LEVEL_THRESHOLDS[i]) {
      return i + 1
    }
  }
  return 1
}
```

**Why this approach?**
- Simple and readable
- Thresholds are small array (10 items)
- Could optimize with binary search if thresholds grow large

### 2. Streak Tracking

**Algorithm**: Date Difference Calculation
```typescript
// Time Complexity: O(1)
// Space Complexity: O(1)

1. Get last workout date (or null)
2. Calculate days difference:
   daysDiff = floor((today - lastWorkout) / millisecondsPerDay)
3. If daysDiff === 1: streak continues
4. If daysDiff > 1: streak broken, reset to 1
5. If daysDiff === 0: same day, don't change
```

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- First workout ever (lastWorkoutDate is null)
- Same day multiple workouts
- Timezone considerations (using setHours to normalize)

### 3. Exercise Filtering & Grouping

**Data Structure**: Hash Map / Object
```typescript
// Groups exercises by muscle group
const grouped: Record<string, Exercise[]> = {}
exercises.forEach(ex => {
  const mg = ex.muscleGroup.toLowerCase()
  if (!grouped[mg]) grouped[mg] = []
  grouped[mg].push(ex)
})
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of exercises
**Space Complexity**: O(n)

### 4. Workout Day Rotation

**Algorithm**: Modulo Arithmetic
```typescript
// Determines which day of a plan to show today
const daysSinceStart = floor((today - plan.createdAt) / millisecondsPerDay)
const dayIndex = daysSinceStart % plan.days.length
```

**Example**: 
- Plan has 3 days (Push, Pull, Legs)
- Day 0: Push, Day 1: Pull, Day 2: Legs
- Day 3: Push (cycle repeats)

### 5. Leaderboard Ranking

**Algorithm**: Multi-field Sorting
```typescript
// Orders by:
1. workoutsThisWeek (descending)
2. totalXp (descending) - tiebreaker

// SQL equivalent:
ORDER BY workoutsThisWeek DESC, totalXp DESC
```

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - database sorting
**Space Complexity**: O(n) - result set

### 6. Reward Unlocking

**Algorithm**: Set Intersection
```typescript
1. Query rewards where:
   (requiredLevel <= userLevel) OR (requiredStreak <= userStreak)
2. For each matching reward:
   - Check if already unlocked (unique constraint)
   - If not, create UserReward entry
```

**Optimization**: Uses Prisma's `OR` query to filter in database rather than in application code.

---

## API Design

### RESTful Conventions

**Endpoints follow REST principles**:
- `GET /api/plans` - List resources
- `GET /api/plans/active` - Get specific resource
- `POST /api/plans/generate` - Create resource
- `DELETE /api/plans/[id]` - Delete resource
- `POST /api/plans/[id]/activate` - Action on resource

### Authentication Pattern

**All protected endpoints**:
1. Check for session via `getServerSession(authOptions)`
2. Return 401 if unauthorized
3. Verify resource ownership (for user-specific resources)
4. Return 403 if user doesn't own resource

### Error Handling

**Consistent error responses**:
```typescript
{
  error: string  // Human-readable error message
}
```

**Status Codes**:
- 200: Success
- 201: Created
- 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
- 401: Unauthorized (not logged in)
- 403: Forbidden (no permission)
- 404: Not Found
- 500: Internal Server Error

### Data Validation

**Client-side**: Form validation in React components
**Server-side**: Type checking and required field validation
**Database**: Prisma schema enforces types and constraints

---

## Frontend Architecture

### State Management

**Pattern**: Local Component State + Server State
- React `useState` for UI state
- `useSession` from NextAuth for auth state
- Fetch on mount/action for server data

**No global state library** (Redux, Zustand) - not needed for MVP scope

### Component Patterns

**1. Container/Presentational Pattern**:
- Pages are containers (fetch data, handle actions)
- Components are presentational (display data, emit events)

**2. Compound Components**:
- Card with CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter
- Flexible composition

**3. Controlled Components**:
- All form inputs are controlled (value + onChange)
- Single source of truth

### Routing

**Next.js App Router**:
- File-based routing
- Dynamic routes: `[dayId]`, `[id]`
- Route groups for organization

### Styling Approach

**Tailwind CSS Utility Classes**:
- No separate CSS files
- Responsive design with breakpoint prefixes (md:, lg:)
- Dark mode support (prepared but not implemented)

**Component Variants**:
- Using `class-variance-authority` for button/card variants
- Type-safe variant props

---

## Programming Practices & Patterns

### 1. Type Safety

**TypeScript throughout**:
- All functions have type annotations
- Interfaces for component props
- Prisma generates types from schema

**Benefits**:
- Catch errors at compile time
- Better IDE autocomplete
- Self-documenting code

### 2. Error Handling

**Try-Catch Blocks**:
- All async operations wrapped
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

**Example Pattern**:
```typescript
try {
  const response = await fetch(...)
  if (!response.ok) {
    const error = await response.json()
    setError(error.error || 'Operation failed')
    return
  }
  // Success handling
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error)
  setError('An error occurred')
}
```

### 3. Database Transactions

**Prisma Best Practices**:
- Use `createMany` for bulk inserts
- Use `updateMany` for bulk updates
- Cascade deletes configured in schema
- Unique constraints prevent duplicates

### 4. Security Practices

**Password Security**:
- bcrypt hashing (10 rounds)
- Never store plain text
- Never return passwordHash in API responses

**Authentication**:
- JWT tokens signed with secret
- Session validation on every request
- Middleware protects routes

**Authorization**:
- Verify resource ownership
- Check user permissions
- Prevent self-actions (e.g., following yourself)

### 5. Code Organization

**Separation of Concerns**:
- `/lib` - Business logic
- `/app/api` - API endpoints
- `/app` - Pages/UI
- `/components` - Reusable UI

**Single Responsibility**:
- Each file has one clear purpose
- Functions do one thing
- Components are focused

### 6. Performance Optimizations

**Database Queries**:
- Use `include` to fetch related data in one query
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Index on frequently queried fields (userId, active)

**Frontend**:
- Lazy loading (Next.js handles this)
- Conditional rendering
- Memoization not needed yet (small data sets)

### 7. Data Conversion

**User Input → Database Storage**:
- Height: feet/inches → centimeters
- Weight: pounds → kilograms
- Equipment: array → JSON

**Why store in metric?**
- Consistent units across all users
- Easier calculations
- International standard

### 8. State Management Patterns

**Optimistic Updates** (not implemented yet, but prepared):
- Could update UI before API response
- Rollback on error

**Current Approach**:
- Fetch → Update → Refetch
- Simple and reliable
- Good for MVP

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Custom Exercise Selection?

**Decision**: Let users choose exercises instead of auto-generating

**Rationale**:
- Users know what equipment they have
- Users have preferences
- Builds engagement (ownership)
- Foundation for AI recommendations (learn from choices)

### 2. Why Two-Phase Workout (Planning + Logging)?

**Decision**: Separate planning from logging

**Rationale**:
- Users might forget to plan beforehand
- Can set parameters during workout
- Flexible workflow
- Data collection for both planned and actual performance

### 3. Why Store Sets/Reps/Rest in WorkoutDayExercise?

**Decision**: Store in join table, not separate table

**Rationale**:
- Each exercise in a plan can have different parameters
- Same exercise in different plans can have different sets/reps
- Normalized data structure
- Easy to update

### 4. Why Limit to 4 Plans?

**Decision**: Hard limit on number of plans

**Rationale**:
- Prevents database bloat
- Encourages users to maintain active plans
- UI stays manageable
- Can be increased later if needed

### 5. Why JWT Sessions?

**Decision**: Stateless JWT over database sessions

**Rationale**:
- Scalable (no session store needed)
- Works with serverless (Vercel)
- Simpler architecture
- Trade-off: Can't revoke sessions easily (acceptable for MVP)

### 6. Why PostgreSQL?

**Decision**: PostgreSQL over MongoDB or SQLite

**Rationale**:
- Relational data (users, plans, exercises, logs)
- Complex queries (leaderboards, analytics)
- ACID compliance
- Prisma support
- Free tier available (Neon, Supabase)

## Testing Strategy (Not Yet Implemented)

### Unit Tests
- `lib/xp.ts` - XP calculation, level progression
- `lib/generator.ts` - Plan generation logic
- Streak calculation edge cases

### Integration Tests
- API endpoints with test database
- Authentication flows
- Workout logging flow

### E2E Tests (Planned)
- Complete user journey: Register → Onboard → Create Plan → Log Workout
- Social features: Follow → Leaderboard
- Reward unlocking

---

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Application URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - JWT signing secret

### Database Migrations
- Use `prisma migrate` for production
- `prisma db push` for development only

### Performance
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Consider caching for leaderboards (Redis)
- Image optimization if avatars added

### Security
- Rate limiting on API endpoints (future)
- Input sanitization (Prisma handles SQL injection)
- CORS configuration for production

## Common Patterns Used

### 1. Upsert Pattern
```typescript
await prisma.userProfile.upsert({
  where: { userId },
  update: { ... },
  create: { ... }
})
```
Used for: UserProfile (create or update)

### 2. Bulk Operations
```typescript
await prisma.exerciseLog.createMany({
  data: exerciseLogsArray
})
```
Used for: Creating multiple exercise logs at once

### 3. Conditional Updates
```typescript
await prisma.workoutPlan.updateMany({
  where: { userId, active: true },
  data: { active: false }
})
```
Used for: Deactivating all plans before activating one

### 4. Include Pattern
```typescript
const plan = await prisma.workoutPlan.findUnique({
  include: {
    days: {
      include: {
        exercises: {
          include: { exercise: true }
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```
Used for: Fetching related data in one query
